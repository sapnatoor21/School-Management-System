### School Management System in Python using Tkinter

This project is a simple **School Management System** application built in Python with the **Tkinter** library for GUI development. The system allows users to add, edit, and view student information in a structured manner. Below is a detailed description of the code and its functionalities.

### Features
1. **Add Student**: Allows users to enter student details (Name, Class, Roll No, Age) and save them to a list.
2. **Edit Student**: Enables modification of existing student details by selecting them from the list and updating the relevant fields.
3. **Load Student**: Automatically populates the fields with a student's information when they are selected from the list, facilitating quick edits.
4. **Student List Display**: Displays all saved student data in a tabular format, making it easy to view and manage student records.

### Code Breakdown

1. **GUI Setup**:
   - The main Tkinter window (`root`) is created with a specified title and size.
   - Labels, entry fields, and buttons are arranged in a frame to keep the layout organized.
   - A `Treeview` widget from Tkinter’s `ttk` module is used to display the list of students in a table format.

2. **Data Management**:
   - A list named `students` stores each student’s details as a dictionary with keys: "Name", "Class", "Roll No", and "Age".
   - Functions such as `add_student`, `edit_student`, and `load_student` handle the creation, modification, and retrieval of student data from the list.

3. **Functions**:
   - **add_student**: Collects data from input fields, checks for existing roll numbers, and adds the new student to the list if all fields are filled out.
   - **clear_entries**: Clears the input fields after an action is completed.
   - **update_student_list**: Updates the display in the `Treeview` widget by clearing the existing list and inserting all current student records.
   - **edit_student**: Modifies the details of a selected student based on their roll number.
   - **load_student**: Loads a selected student's data from the list into the entry fields for easy editing.

### GUI Layout

- **Input Fields**: Contains fields for entering student information.
- **Buttons**:
   - **Add Student**: Adds a new student to the list.
   - **Edit Student**: Allows modifications to a selected student's data.
   - **Load Student**: Loads the selected student’s data into input fields for editing.

- **Table Display**: The `Treeview` widget displays each student's data in a structured grid with columns for Name, Class, Roll No, and Age.

### Installation and Requirements

- This application requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library (Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python).
- No additional libraries are required, making it easy to set up and run.

### Future Improvements

- **Delete Functionality**: Add a feature to delete student records.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to filter students by name, class, or roll number.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load student data from an external database or file, allowing data retention between sessions.
